/*
 A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
 
 Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
 
 Write a function:
 
 class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }
 
 that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
 
 For example, given:
 
 X = 10
 Y = 85
 D = 30
 the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
 
 after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
 after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
 after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
 Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 
 X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
 X â‰¤ Y.

let x = 10
let y = 85
let d = 30

public func solution(_ X : Int, _ Y : Int, _ D : Int) -> Int {

    let targetDistance = Y - X
    var count = 0
    
    guard X < Y else { return count }
    
    if targetDistance % D != 0 {
        count = (targetDistance / D) + 1
    } else {
        count = targetDistance / D
    }
    
    return count
